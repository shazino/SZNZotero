Feel free to comment and/or contribute to SZNZotero. Hacking it should be fun, and if for some reason it’s a pain to do let us know so we can fix it.

## Workflow

Here’s the most direct way to get your work merged into the project:
- Fork the project
- Clone down your fork (`git clone git://github.com/<username>/SZNZotero.git`)
- Create a topic branch to contain your change (`git checkout -b my_awesome_feature`)
- Hack away!
- If necessary, rebase your commits into logical chunks, without errors
- Push the branch up (`git push origin my_awesome_feature`)
- Create an issue with a description and link to your branch
